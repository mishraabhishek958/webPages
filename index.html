  “I don’t know about cricket but still I watch cricket to see Sachin play..Not because I love his play its because I want to know the reason why my country’s production goes down by 5 percent when he’s in batting.” <br/>

  I see myself when I see Sachin's batting. <br/>

  Even if my grand children don't remember the fact I scored 10,000 runs in One Day and Test Cricket,they will surely talk about the fact that I was a teammate of Sachin Tendulkar. <br />

<u><h2> A special note to My Favourite Player of all time</h2></u><br />
<p> Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar is not the name for me he is indeed the God of Cricket. I'm one of his fan in his great fan following. I loved to see the cricket when he used to enter the cricket ground. I never wanted him to get retired from the cricket. It's been the great regret for me that I have not seen him playing live on the cricket field. He will always be on the top of my favorite list. Many players may come and go , but noone will ever match his potential and his passion for the cricket. Sir You will always be my hero whether you play or not. Thank you for giving us the great uncountable memories.May God give the long life to the God of Cricket. I know if I kept on writing the page will never end. In short SACHIN SACHIN SACHIN......<br />
